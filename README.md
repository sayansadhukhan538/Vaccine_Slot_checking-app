# Vaccine_Slot_checking-app
Here I have designed the front-end of Covid-19 Vaccination Slot checking application with the help of Co-WIN Public APIs. In this main page there are 2 textfields, in first one we have to entered 6 digit PIN Code of India where we want to check the Vaccination centre available for the particular date or not. Then we have to confirm the date and the months of the year from the drop-down list. Here are some of the screenshots I have given.



This is the home page of our user interface.
